# Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a complete machine learning classification pipeline. The project covers the entire processâ€”from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. It is intended as a technical demonstration of best practices in building a robust classification model.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict class labels based on a given set of features. The notebook walks through the challenges of handling real-world data, including missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling, before training and validating several classification algorithms. 

## Project Structure

**classification.ipynb**: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
  - Feature engineering and selection
  - Implementation and comparison of multiple classification models
  - Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
  - Visualization of performance metrics and model insights

  **app.py**: The Streamlit application file for real-time Alzheimer's prediction. It:
  - Presents an interactive UI for patient data input
  - Encodes and preprocesses the input data
  - Loads a pre-trained model to predict Alzheimer's risk
  - Displays the prediction outcome on the app interface

## Results and Discussion
- The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the experimental results. Key findings are discussed, including:
- Comparative performance of different classifiers.
- Insights from the confusion matrix and ROC analysis.
- Trade-offs between model complexity and performance.
- Potential areas for further optimization or exploration.
